    observing it during compilation, the last command seemed to
    eat up about 2 GB of RAM every second, on my system starting
    from memory consumption of ~1.5GB, to taking up 15.4 (GB) (max)
    in a matter of only several seconds. At which point, all cpus
    started going to max, and Swap memory filled up very quickly (~1 GB),
    at which point the OOM killer came and did its job, and all memory
    was free again. (down to ~1.5GB)
    Need to verify that this is not due to the build script, or the fact
    that it's run in docker.
