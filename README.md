# fst-web-interface

The frontend web interface for the collection of language tools.

## Development

## Prerequisites

Being a web project, make sure to have a working version of `node`, as
well as `npm` (or `pnpm`) installed on your system.

Packages called `node` or `nodejs` should be available in most
distributions.

## Installation

To run the development server, navigate to the folder after cloning,
and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giellatekno/fst-web-interface
cd fst-web-interface
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now visit the locally running development server at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
Changing source files will instantly be reflected in the browser window, due to
something called "hot module reloading".
